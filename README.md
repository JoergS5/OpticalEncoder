# OpticalEncoder
Creating an Optical Encoder for 3D printers or robots, e. g. for closed loop motors. Current plan is to use a camera to read the encoder information and let a ESP32 or Raspi create quadrature encoder signals.

MainCreateRoundEncoder creates round printouts. The dot positions are not exact, so this method is deprecated, the program remains for archiving.

MainCreateLinearEncoder.java is a program to create the OpticalEncoder printout to be printed at the side of a plate which is the actuator (e.g. gear of a robot arm). A 600 dpi printer can printout:
- values from +2350 to -2350, total of 4701 values
- the created png should be tagges with dpi values 600 dpi resolution in both directions
- the printout is 20 cm long, which is 360Â° for a 30 mm radius circle
- the printer setup shall print the original size with dpi settings without resizing
- The resoltuion can be higher than printer's resolution using the camera to analyze dot positions. The 600 dpi dots are 40 micrometers each, camera pixel are often 2 micrometer or less.
